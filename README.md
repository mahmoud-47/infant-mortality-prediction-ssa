# Infant Mortality Prediction Model for Sub-Saharan Africa

This repository contains the code and materials from a **hackathon project** focused on addressing **infant mortality** in **Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)**. The goal of this project was to develop a **data-driven model** that helps **local governments** predict infant mortality rates based on key health metrics, such as **vaccination rates**, **healthcare coverage**, **prematurity**, and **birth asphyxia**. The model aims to assist governments in assessing the potential outcomes of their planned actions, like healthcare interventions and vaccination campaigns, and to support better decision-making for improving infant survival rates.

## **Key Features:**
- **Data-driven model** to predict infant mortality based on healthcare-related factors.
- **Correlation analysis** to identify the most influential health indicators, such as vaccines and skilled birth attendance.
- **Decision-making tool** to help governments assess the impact of their actions on infant mortality.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
- **Data Sources**: Various health and mortality reports for SSA countries

## **Project Structure:**
- `code.ipynb`: The main Python script that contains the model and functions for making predictions.
- `data/`: A folder containing sample data files used for training and testing the model.
- `presentation.pdf`: The presentation slide deck summarizing the project and results.

## **How to Use:**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-47/infant-mortality-prediction-ssa
   cd infant-mortality-prediction-ssa
